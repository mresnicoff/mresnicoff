### Dino Game:
To test my JavaScript skills, I decided to give a thrilling twist to the classic Dino game. I equipped the Dino with a powerful gun, adding an exciting layer of strategy and precision.

### Memory game:
To test my DOM manipulation skills, I transformed a single-player memory game into an engaging two-player experience. Through dynamic scoring and interactive elements, players can now compete head-to-head, flipping cards and matching pairs. Experience the thrill of multiplayer competition and put your memory skills to the test in this enhanced game!.

### The weather App:
The weather app was one of my initial projects on React, created alongside a few friends from the SUP program at Soy Henry's bootcamp. My primary focus was implementing the feature that enables the app to display the weather information based on the user's current location. Additionally, I contributed to the app's styling to enhance its visual appeal.

### Rick & Morty APP
The Rick and Morty app served as our integration project during the Soy Henry bootcamp. I took a unique approach by utilizing a JSON file as a database, allowing for multi-user functionality in my version. I won a mention for this work at the bootcamp.

### Countries
The countries project was my individual endeavor during the Soy Henry Bootcamp. I was able to showcase my learning by implementing card displays, creating filters, and uploading information through forms. During the presentation, I even made a live change, which added an extra level of excitement to the experience.
